Challenges:
Time to do the training as well as time to develop appropriate training
Support from senior management
Lack of regulation
Engagement - training does not always link to the day to day job
Lack of standards
Priority - not taken seriously
Exposure of Infosec in NEDS
Budget for training


Solutions:
Keep things interactive; e.g. using HIPB to check whether email addreses have been breached
Make it personal - when people have more knowledge to manage risks at home that will filter through to work
Talking about breaches and related financial losses - telling stories
Security champions program
Include security awareness in induction training
Dedicated role just for security training
Talk to people - understand their challenges and provide advice specific to those challenges.
Building relationships
Use different channels and media - PowerPoint, Video
When analysing investment, remember to invest in People, Process and Technology
Consider apprentiship programs
